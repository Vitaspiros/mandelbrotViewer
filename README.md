# Mandelbrot Viewer

A simple program written in C++ and OpenGL that renders the Mandelbrot Fractal. This is a rewrite of the older and slower [mandelbrotVisualizer](https://github.com/Vitaspiros/mandelbrotVisualizer), which is written in Java.

## Configuration
There is no configuration options right now (except from tweaking the code). 
I will need to add them later. 
Right now the program computes the fractal with 500 iterations.

## Features
- Render the fractal with colors
- Pan, zoom in and out

## Compiling and Running
```
make
./main.out
```
Required dependencies: glfw3
